# This project can be divided into 3 Parts

## 1st Part  
 * In this part we need to preprocess the data.  
 Acquire physiomarkers that are important for identifying the sepsis disease.  

 * Since the data from CITI website can't be accessed due to unavailabitlity of login credential. I can't find a good high frequency of sepsis dataset online thus we need to skip this part for now.  

 * Lets assume we have the data set with all the physiological data  
 [temperature, sao2, heartrate, respiration, cvp, etco2, st1, st2, st3, icp]  

 * We will use various statistics method to get good physiomarkers for the dataset.
 Lets assume these are the important physiomarkers for sepsis prediction [temperature, sao2, cvp, etco2, systemicystolic, systemicmean, st2,st2, icp]

## 2nd Part

 * In this part we will make different Temporal convolution neural network (t-CNN) architecture  with input data as the physiomarkers that are acquired in phase 1.

 * Training the architectures on train data.
 * Testing the architectures on test data.
 * Evaluating those architectures on the different metrics to identify the best performing architecture.

## 3rd Part

 * In this part we will Integrate the model to a python module.
 
 * Unit test the module created.
 
 * Add all the documentation for further enhancement of the project in future
