Deep learning model for sepsis prediction using high-frequency data

## Abstract
---
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates. Early detection and treatment are critical to improving outcomes

Sepsis occurs when chemicals released in the bloodstream to fight an infection trigger inflammation throughout the body. This can cause a cascade of changes that damage multiple organ systems, leading them to fail, sometimes even resulting in death.

## Method
